## Description

The MVP for our project is to be able to recognise  
a body part and have it utilise it as a user input for a game

## Technologies

Python 3.7.7
OpenCV

## How to Use

Will need help filling out this field. To be completed.

## Future Improvements

If the game was to be developed further the following might be a good place to start:

* Maintain aspect ratio while scaling
* Prevent projectile projectile entering scoring area when extreme rescaling
* Improve cpu
* Create two player local and or online multiplayer
* Write tests, especially important if the project was to be progressed any significant amount further
